# Oanda_RESTV20_Python
This just contains some example code and documents that I believe would be a little better than looking at the APIs.

I made these docs because as I tried to learn about the Oanda REST v20 API and the oandapyV20 Python wrapper, I could not find a beginner friendly tutorial, unless you are comfortable reading API documentation. This is where this repo fits in.

Also, I found a couple of mistakes in the price streaming example on the oandapyV20 doc that I corrected. Finally and most importantly, I expanded the examples for placing orders a little more cover the following:
1. Stop Loss
2. Trailing Stop
3. Take Profit
